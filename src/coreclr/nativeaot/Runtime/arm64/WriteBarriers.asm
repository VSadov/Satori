;; Macro used to copy contents of newly updated GC heap locations to a shadow copy of the heap. This is used
;; during garbage collections to verify that object references where never written to the heap without using a
;; write barrier. Note that we're potentially racing to update the shadow heap while other threads are writing
;; new references to the real heap. Since this can't be solved perfectly without critical sections around the
;; entire update process, we instead update the shadow location and then re-check the real location (as two
;; ordered operations) and if there is a disparity we'll re-write the shadow location with a special value
;; (INVALIDGCVALUE) which disables the check for that location. Since the shadow heap is only validated at GC
;; time and these write barrier operations are atomic wrt to GCs this is sufficient to guarantee that the
;; shadow heap contains only valid copies of real heap values or INVALIDGCVALUE.
